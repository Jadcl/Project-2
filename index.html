  <p class="paddedcontent">My journey to web development has not been linear.
   If you asked me two years ago if I saw myself here, I would tell you absolutely not.
   However, after going to college for economics, working in management and then transfering to be a data analyst position, this is very on-brand of me.
   I have been in the workforce for less than three years and I have struggled to find my niche.
   I start off super-excited and then I get bored at doing the same thing everyday.I always have loved creating,
   but I also panic when things are not certain. I spent some time exposing myself to careers that would fulfill me in both areas and I landed here.
   Thus far, I am very proud of what I have been able to learn. I like the fact that I am coding and creating something that is visually appealing and functional.
   By the end of this program, I hope to have grasped enough information to be able to replicate some of the most complicated and appealing web designs out there.
